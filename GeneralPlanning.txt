GENERAL PLANNING

---ABSTRACT---
The goal of the project is to create a program that can
self generate poems.  The implementation will be based around a 
deep neural network, which will take in poems as training data
and attempt to learn to write poems on its own.  Additionally, 
a possible extension of the program would be to complete a poem
that a user inputs to start.
